OTF is a grantee of the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) and is funded by the U.S. government through annual appropriations passed by the United States Congress to support “programs to promote internet freedom globally.” OTF’s appropriations are included as a component of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs for each fiscal year.

Per Congressional appropriations requirements, each year, the USAGM submits an “Internet FreedomSpend Plan” to Congress outlining its proposed use of internet freedom funds appropriated in that fiscal year. The USAGM Internet Freedom Spend Plan is reviewed and approved by Congress prior to implementation.

In FY2021, Congress appropriated $40.7 million for “satellite transmissions and internet freedom programs” to USAGM, of which USAGM provided $19,877,529 to OTF to support internet freedom programs.
