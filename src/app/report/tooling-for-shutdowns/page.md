Over the past two years, we have seen the rapid evolution of internet shutdowns as a tool of repressive information control. Once thought to be too economically and politically costly to turn to for anything butas a last resort in a politically existential crisis, shutdowns as a tool of control are now regularly relied upon by authoritarian governments. In many countries, shutdowns can now be administered in a more targeted and nuanced manner, making them less costly for the authoritarian government imposing them while still being extremely difficult to technically mitigate.

As a result, OTF is funding shutdown mitigation solutions that attempt to address the technical challenges users face experiencing every level of shutdown, from those which disable only one form of communication in a targeted fashion to total communications infrastructure blackouts.

Two important contributions to the efforts funded with FY2021 funds include **Ouinet** and **SMS Without Borders**.

**Ouinet** is a free, open-source technology that allows web content to be served with the help of a network of cooperating nodes using peer-to-peer routing and distributed caching of responses. Built as an integration, it can be used to enable a network exchange of cached data to circumvent censorship and mitigate the effects of some forms of internet shutdowns. If a country cuts itself off from the global internet but national or subnational networks remain functional, Ouinet allows cached content to be shared in a way that mirrors traditional web browsing without needing to pull content from the global internet.

**SMS Without Borders** patches an important security vulnerability in what has become a common form of shutdown, in which a regime shutsdown mobile data but leaves calling and SMS capabilities unaffected. One consequence of this form of shutdown is that those secure messaging apps requiring mobile data are rendered unusable, presenting users with the unsavory choice between communicating via easily surveilable SMS messages or not at all. SMS Without Borders encrypts SMS messages to ensure that if journalists or activists are forced to use SMS during an internet shutdown, the content of their communications can remain safe.
