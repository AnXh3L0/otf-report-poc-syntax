OTF’s Rapid Response Fund (RFF) provides emergency support to independent media outlets, journalists, and human rights defenders facing digital attacks. The support through this fund helps these individuals and groups stay safe in repressive environments, regain online access, mitigate future attacks, and combat sudden censorship events.

In FY2021, OTF facilitated timely and comprehensive emergency responses around the world. OTF provided security audits, website sanitation, secure hosting, security protocol improvements, and more to civil society organizations while also providing direct funding for in-country internet freedom support.
