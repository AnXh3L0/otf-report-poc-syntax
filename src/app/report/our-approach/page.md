To advance its mission to support internet freedom in repressive environments, OTF provides directfunding and support services to individuals and organizations around the world that are addressingthreats to internet freedom, journalism, and human rights with technology-backed solutions.OTF provides funding and support through a variety of mechanisms in order to provide tailored andcomprehensive assistance to internet freedom projects. Because internet censorship technology andtactics are constantly evolving, OTF receives, reviews, and contracts projects on an ongoing basis via opencalls. OTF solicits project ideas through a fully open and competitive application process on its website.The process is designed to reduce barriers to applying for funding and make funding more accessible toqualified individuals and organizations around the world. These efforts help attract innovative applicationsfrom groups that traditionally are not able to apply for federal funds, including expert technologists,frontline journalists, human rights defenders, cutting-edge researchers, and digital security specialists.

In order to ensure a high degree of due diligence, OTF implements a rigorous multistage application reviewprocess, throughout which successful applications are ultimately improved and refined. All proposalsare reviewed by OTF’s specialized staff of subject matter experts as well as OTF’s Advisory Council—agroup of nearly 40 technical, regional, and specialized experts from a wide range of relevant disciplines—to provide feedback and guidance. In addition to ensuring that the most competitive and impactfulprojects are funded, this multistage review process also achieves maximum efficiency, collaboration, andeconomies of scale, resulting in substantial savings of public funds.
