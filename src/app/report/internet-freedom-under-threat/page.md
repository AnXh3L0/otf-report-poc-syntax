Authoritarian control of the internet is on the rise. Across the world, repressive regimes are utilizing more aggressive tactics to divide the open internet into more easily controllable digital territories, representing some of the sharpest downturns in internet freedom to date.[^1]

Reliance on internet access has grown to unprecedented levels around the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This increase in adoption has resulted in a commensurate crackdown on free expression onlineas authoritarian governments work diligently to implement ever more stringent information controls. Online censorship is at an all-time high worldwide, and by relying on digital surveillance and censorship, repressive governments have gained access to extraordinary amounts of information on citizens. These efforts have only accelerated due to the proliferation of technologies such as artificial intelligence and facial recognition.

Historically, in most of the authoritarian world, online censorship has ebbed and flowed. Important state anniversaries, periods of political unrest, and unpredicted social phenomena could all trigger heightened public interest in information that would, in turn, lead to heightened censorship by authorities. This was naturally reflected in the use of OTF-supported circumvention tools, where surges in tool use routinely occurred around such events before returning to normal levels.

However, this predictable dynamic appears to be fundamentally changing as what were once temporary peaks in usage have now become new permanent plateaus. Following the 2021 coup in Myanmar, the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the Mahsa Amini protests in Iran, online censorship in these countries has reached new heights. As a result, the use of OTF-supported circumvention tools has not only surged but also remained extremely high, confounding the old expectation of a return to baseline.

While the main indicator that is observable to us outside these countries is the continued use ofcircumvention tools beyond the apex of a political crisis, this is likely best understood as a necessary response to authoritarian regimes who, after stepping up censorship during a crisis, do not revert to a looser grip post-crisis. These dynamics are only further exacerbated by the blocking of large global social media platforms, which has gone from a China-only exception to an authoritarian norm.

Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin moved aggressively to centralize power amid the country’s invasion of Ukraine, utilizing the country’s growing investments in repression technology to silence dissenting voices and curb the spread of information.

The digital environment in Russia deteriorated dramatically when the government blocked many of the most widely used global social media and content platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Censors also targeted the websites of Radio Free Europe and Voice of America.[^2]

The challenges associated with reporting on the war in Ukraine for independent Russian news outlets have ballooned, as many ceased operations following Putin’s signing of a “fake news” law that threatened imprisonment for any journalist deviating from the Kremlin’s portrayal of the conflict.[^3] The audiences for these outlets faced similar obstacles in accessing their content, resulting in dramatic growth in the adoption of circumvention tools. Despite repeated attempts to interfere with the functionality, tools such as the Tor Browser quickly adapted their technology to overcome these efforts.[^4] This was a result of deepening collaboration between end users, researchers, and the tools themselves.

Meanwhile, China witnessed widespread protests in the fall of 2022. In response, the Chinese government deployed increasingly sophisticated censorship tactics, including interfering with censorship circumvention tools. As a result of these measures and the associated timing, in-country developers focused on overcoming the new tactics by collaborating and sharing what advanced techniques could pierce the blockade. China instituted a more limited and targeted escalation of censorship surrounding the 2022 Beijing Olympics by jailing activists and taking numerous steps to control the online narrative of the event.[^5] This was in addition to ongoing efforts to control the algorithms used by the country’s largest online platforms to ensure they “carry forward the Socialist core value view” and to censor open source code until it receives government approval.[^6] In October 2022, China held the National Congress for the Communist Party and employed new techniques by utilizing TLS fingerprinting, likely throughmachine learning techniques, to interfere with many of the most utilized circumvention techniques.[^7] [^8] Nonetheless, the event that created the biggest challenges occurred the following month when unprecedented protests took place, voicing opposition toward the government’s extensive use of lockdowns to control COVID outbreaks. The nature and scale of the mobilization left censors scrambling to keep up.[^9] This development demonstrated that the country’s censorship apparatus struggles to scale when the population expresses widespread discontent.

Similarly, protests broke out in Iran in the fall of 2022 following the death of Mahsa Amini. This resulted not only in internet shutdowns to curb the spread of content and silence protesters but also in the targeting of virtually every channel of communication.[^10] The government sought to curb access to the two remaining and most popular social media platforms, WhatsApp and Instagram.[^11] Government censors also took numerous steps to increase censorship through the targeting of encrypted DNS, HTTP/3, app stores, and browser extension repositories.[^12]

The government has attempted to poison the market for circumvention tools by deploying copycat apps to lure unsuspecting Iranians into installing malware.[^13] Researchers also uncovered technology being relied on by the government to remotely manipulate cellular connections to access a device or prevent two-factor SMS authentication.[^14] This is in addition to continuing to carry out hacking attempts targeting Middle East-focused researchers, civil society groups, and dissidents.[^15] Despite these expansive efforts, usage of OTF-supported circumvention tools jumped from six million daily users to nearly 30 million.[^16] This mirrors noteworthy increases in the broader VPN industry.[^17] The results of these efforts are apparent in the extent of information critical of the government finding its way onto blocked platforms and the widespread usage occurring more generally.[^18]

In addition to Iran, many other authoritarian governments have continued to rely on internet shutdowns to prevent access to the internet. As a result, internet shutdowns have quickly become a frequently used mechanism to quell protests, silence activists, and stymie the spread of information. In 2022, governments significantly disrupted or completely shut down the internet at least 187 times across 35 countries, marking a resurgence in use after a decrease during the height of thepandemic.[^19] Troublingly, these shutdowns are more often used to target specific populations and are longer in duration than in previous years. India, the world’s largest democracy, implemented 84 shutdowns last year, and it remains the country with the highest recorded shutdowns for the fifth consecutive year.[^20] Other repressive states have been able to effectively deploy shutdowns to limit the flow of information, such as during protest movements in Iran and during elections in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Meanwhile, sustained restrictions continue to obscure ongoing human rights abuses in Myanmar and Ethiopia’s Tigray region. This comes despite the serious economic consequences that prevent all online commerce, regardless of how it is taking place.

Despite the rise of these global threats, a record 26 countries experienced improvements in internet freedom. Collaborative efforts between civil society, technologists, and policymakers in many countries have resulted in better legislation, media resiliency, and accountability among technology companies to foster progress for digital rights.[^21] Still, as a result of increased surveillance and censorship, significant threats to internet freedom remain. The emergence of new technologies, including machine learning, has made large-scale censorship easier and faster. In addition, more authoritarian governments are adopting methods to establish national intranets to further control their citizens’ access to information, while the proliferation of commercial spyware is making it easier for authoritarian governments to track and target civil society and human rights defenders.[^22]
