OTF works to advance internet freedom in repressive environments by supporting the research, development, implementation, and maintenance of technologies that provide secure and uncensored access to the internet to counter attempts by authoritarian governments to restrict freedom online and enable all citizens to exercise their fundamental human rights online.

OTF supports projects in an effort to:

- Provide unrestricted access to the internet to individuals living in information-restrictive countries to help ensure they are able to safely access the uncensored internet. This includes supporting the development and deployment of an array of circumvention technologies to counter increasingly sophisticated censorship techniques, new solutions to counter internet shutdowns, and applied research to help tool developers and users stay ahead of new censorship threats.
- Protect journalists, human rights defenders, and marginalized communities from repressive surveillance and digital attacks to help ensure they are able to safely access and share information online. This includes support for secure communication tools, targeted digital security interventions, and other forms of privacy and security technology.
