As the cost of digital surveillance capabilities, once reserved only for global superpowers, becomes affordable to even modestly resourced authoritarians, the ability for journalists, activists, and human rights defenders to carry out their work relies on careful adherence to digital security best practices and innovative technological solutions.

In FY2021, OTF made investments in both threat identification and tracking as well as technologies that advanced the state of the art in applied digital security protections.

The **Global Surveillance Database** project compiled available data from export licensing authorities and relevant reporting on the use of surveillance technologies, including Pegasus in Thailand, IMSI-catchers in Indonesia, and global SS7-attacks (a security exploit that takes advantage of a weakness in the design of Signaling System 7 that enables data theft and eavesdropping) in Libya, Malaysia, Italy, Nicaragua, and Pakistan to better inform regional and local actors of specific threat vectors and encourage appropriate mitigations.

As advanced surveillance techniques have become more widely available, it is imperative that the capabilities of local journalism and human rights organizations to detect and repel digital attacks also increase. **PiRogue Tool Suite** is an open-source tool suite that provides a comprehensive forensic and network traffic analysis platform designed to greatly increase the ability of organizations under threat to assess the privacy and security of mobile devices. Increasing the availability of such advanced threat detection capabilities will help frontline organizations better protect their own security.

In order to further extend the protections of vital secure messaging apps, Project Phoenix aims to bring the new Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol into maturity in a user-facing app. The implementation of MLS to underpin a secure messenger app has the potential to combine Signal’s metadata minimalism with Matrix’s federation features and Wire’s username-based approach and ease of use.

Secure file transfer is one of the most pressing needs of any journalist in a highly surveilled context. The **Filezilla** project will introduce security, privacy, and usability improvements to an implementation of SFTP, a private and secure protocol for file transfer that is relied on by many users in countries without free internet. Filezilla enables people to use SFTP to transfer files with far greater security guarantees.

In addition to on-network and on-device surveillance, OTF has also supported efforts to identify and analyze external surveillance mechanisms, including IMSI-catchers. IMSI-catchers are portable surveillance tools that act as fake cell phone towers to intercept cell phone traffic and are often used for surveillance at particularly crucial moments, such as protests. They present a particularly unique surveillance challenge in that they are very difficult to detect and defend against. The FADE Project expanded studies to detect the use of IMSI-catchers in a standardized way in Latin America to further develop the detection methodology, technical tools, and mitigation strategies for the civil society actors and journalists in the region.
