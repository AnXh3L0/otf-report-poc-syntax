    title: Surging Support for Circumvention Users

Over the past two years, authoritarian regimes around the world have intensified their efforts to censor content and crack down on access to the free and open internet. As a result, demand for OTF-support circumvention tools has increased from an average of nine million users worldwide to over 40 million users on a monthly basis.

Since the invasion of Ukraine, the use of OTF tools in Russia has surged from approximately 250,000 monthly users to over eight million users each month. Similarly, in Iran, the growth in users has leaped from a previous multiyear baseline of five million users per month to over 25 million users (a figure representing approximately half of Iran’s adult population). The use of OTF tools has also increased notably in Myanmar and China.

Despite facing increasingly sophisticated forms of censorship, even at this unprecedented scale of usage, OTF-supported tools continue to perform at the highest technical levels, allowing users in censored areas to securely access blocked content quickly and reliably. In addition, this exponential growth is a testament to the trust that users place in OTF-supported tools, particularly in moments of crisis. Most importantly, these notable increases in demand demonstrate the convening power of technology in today’s society and the importance of ensuring that citizens living under repressive regimes have access to information necessary to hold their governments accountable and to make decisions impacting their lives.

This phenomenon reaffirms the technical efficacy of OTF-supported circumvention tools as they are able to support large user populations in advanced censorship contexts on an ongoing basis. However, it does pose a significant budgetary challenge for both OTF and the circumvention tools, as funding and budgeting have traditionally reflected a need to absorb short surges but did not account for permanent states of consistent surge-level usage.

To address this need, OTF created the Surge and Sustain Fund. This fund is an innovative funding structure designed to offset the marginal carry cost of users in highly censored target countries. This is done on a reimbursement basis whereby the cost of a unique monthly user is offset to ensure that tools are able to support large user bases in countries where the need is greatest and few, if any, secure commercial alternatives exist. Initial providers under the Surge and Sustain Fund [^23] include **Psiphon**, **Lantern**, and **NthLink**. These tools collectively supported nearly eight million unique monthly active users in Russia and over 20 million unique monthly active users in Iran, following sustained surges in use in each country. While not covered by FY2021 funds, the Surge and Sustain tools have since been broadened to include support for users in China and Myanmar.
