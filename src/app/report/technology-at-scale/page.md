OTF’s Technology at Scale Fund supports the large-scale circumvention and secure communication technology needs of USAGM’s networks (Voice of America, Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty, Office of Cuba Broadcasting, Radio Free Asia, and Middle East Broadcasting Networks). The fund solicits technology solutions that help deliver content to audiences in information-restricted environments and protects journalists and their sources. The fund also ensures that technologies used at scale by millions of users remain secure and effective.

## Psiphon Inc.

**$8,083,938**

[Psiphon](https://psiphon.ca/) is one of the most technically advanced and widely used circumvention tools in the world, providing millions of users with uncensored access to USAGM content, as well as access to the broader internet. Psiphon’s technology uses a combination of secure communication and obfuscation technologies and has proven consistently effective in the world’s most highly censored contexts. OTF provided support for SDK (software development kit) services and to support the increased and sustained usage of Psiphon’s circumvention tool for those living in repressive environments seeking to access USAGM content.

## Lantern

**$1,842,780**

[Lantern](https://lantern.io/) is a free internet censorship circumvention tool that delivers fast, reliable, and secure access to the open internet. It provides a way to bypass state-sanctioned filtration through a network of trusted users. Through its mobile application, Lantern’s peer-to-peer (P2P) functionality allows mobile users in uncensored regions to provide access to content for users in censored regions. Lantern provides its circumvention technology services to USAGM, allowing for the secure development and distribution of USAGM digital content, and helps facilitate access to USAGM content, as well as access to the global internet. OTF provided funding to Lantern to support the huge increase in monthly users in Russia and Iran.

## nthLink

**$1,165,975**

[nthLink](https://www.nthlink.com/) is a powerful anti-censorship mobile application capable of circumventing internet censorship and self-recovering from blocking events. It incorporates strong encryption to protect the information flow between the consumer and the source. nthLink aims to create a robust and simple Open Application Programming Interface (API) and Software Development Kit (SDK) for USAGM and other news organizations to integrate their Android and iOS apps with the nthLink censorship circumvention platform to safely and reliably deliver content to at-risk populations in authoritarian regions. OTF provided funding to nthLink to support the nearly 10-fold increase of nthLink monthly users in Russia and Iran. This additional support aided nthLink’s response by increasing server instances to support the surge in users.

## NewNode

**$268,734**

NewNode is the first decentralized peer-to-peer content delivery protocol, enabling data distribution free from censorship, spying, and attack. The tool allows users to request and receive internet content using an encrypted, distributed content delivery network (CDN). NewNode allows global media apps censored in their target countries to function as intended, add scommunication options for users in countries that tier national and international traffic, and offers greater freedom for anyone living in heavily filtered internet regimes. NewNode provides circumvention technology services to USAGM in the form of a Software Development Kit (SDK), integration, and customer support.

## Circumvention Integration in Pangea

**$22,610**

This project contributes to the development of technologies that provide and enhance access for those using USAGM newsreader apps in censored contexts, ensuring audiences continue to receive USAGM content. The project aids RFE/RL’s web app in integrating, testing, andp erforming maintenance tasks on circumvention Software Development Kits (SDKs) for each of RFE/RL’s Pangea web apps to test the performance of Lantern as a possible in-app circumvention solution for censored services using Pangea.

## Guardian Project

**$1,007,143**

The Guardian Project aims to create easy-to-use apps, open-source firmware and software libraries, and customized solutions that can be used around the world by any individual looking to protect their communications and personal data from unjust intrusion. The Guardian Project is using its expertise in the anti-censorship space to help USAGM broadcasters reach their audiences during times of increased censorship and even shutdowns.

## Tor Project

**$412,276**

Tor, short for “The Onion Router,” is a free and open-source software for enabling anonymous communications online. Tor “.onion” web addresses have proven to be one of the most successful mechanisms in overcoming censorship and protecting users’ privacy. The Tor Secure Access Package involves a holistic solution for each USAGM entity website and provides an end-to-end solution for USAGM web content to be distributed in censored or surveilled areas.

## eQualit.ie

**$359,189.96**

eQualit.ie creates decentralized internet services and open-source solutions in support of a more equal and equitable network. eQualit.ie provided a white label release of the CENO Browser application for internet shutdown resilience for USAGM entity websites. CENO Browser will serve all USAGM affiliate content over a peer-to-peer network made up of current and future app users, backed by infrastructure for content distribution and web content scraping.
