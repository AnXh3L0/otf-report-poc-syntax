The internet freedom landscape is an ever-evolving space in which authoritarians seeking to limit their populationsâ€™ access to information are constantly innovating and learning from one another in attempts to create new norms for digital control. Thus, the global internet freedom community must collectively be able to dynamically identify new threats and opportunities and respond quickly to changing circumstances. OTF bolsters this capability through support to key community convenings.

With OTF support, **Team CommUNITY** organized both digital and in-person convenings focused on technical topics, specific communities of practice, and shared threats or needs. These efforts collectively facilitate trust, information sharing, and technical collaboration and result in a more cohesive response and bulwark against new digital threats.
