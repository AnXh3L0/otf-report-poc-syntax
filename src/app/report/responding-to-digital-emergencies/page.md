OTF has, with FY2021 funds, also responded to numerous extremely pressing digital emergencies. Among those of particular note were efforts to surge digital support to those on the frontlines of huge political and military events in Myanmar, Ukraine, Russia, and Iran.

## Myanmar

In 2021, military leaders seized control of the government of Myanmar and immediately imposed vastly increased internet censorship and implemented routine short-term internet shutdowns. To address the security needs of human rights organizations based in Myanmar, OTF continued to provide emergency digital support to civil society organizations (CSOs) to improve freedom of expression and digital rights in the country. Services included digital security audits,recommendations on mobile devices and device security practices, enhancing digital safety protocols, expanding the organizations’ secure communications infrastructure, and rebuilding web platforms to include modern security standards.

## Ukraine

The Russian government invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Immediately following the invasion, OTF focused rapid response support to ensuring that Ukrainian civil society was prepared for the potential of digital attacks by launching **dComm**, a federated network of servers in Ukrainian cities offering decentralized communication services and tools. These servers are designed to remain accessible should external connectivity be restricted or cut. This support was complemented with advanced threat and Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) protection to dozens of websites representing key Ukrainian media and CSOs.

## Russia

Following the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian government dramatically increased censorship efforts, targeting independent news sites (including RFE/RL and VOA) and social media platforms in particular. As a result, the use of OTF-supported circumvention tools increased from a few thousand users pre-invasion to nearly eight million daily users. In response, OTF provided rapid surge funding to these tools to support increased usage. In addition to censoring independent news and social media platforms, Russian authorities also began censoring Tor in the run-up to the invasion of Ukraine. Due to its circumvention, security, and privacy guarantees, Tor is widely used in Russia to access content censored by the Russian government. In response, OTF supported new circumvention deployment methodologies for Tor, which were further refined and extended post-invasion to ensure that Russians could continue to safely access outside news and information despite new restrictions and legal threats.

## Iran

In September 2022, 22-year-old Mahsa Amini was arrested by Iran’s Ersahd morality police and died in custody. In response to her death, massive protests against Iran’s morality laws erupted across the country. In an attempt to crack down on the protests, the Iranian government quickly shut down mobile networks and internet access across the country and further intensified online censorship, including blocking social media platforms. As a result, the use of the OTF-supported circumvention tools skyrocketed, increasing from five million users per month to over 25 million users. In response, OTF provided rapid surge funding to these tools to support increased usage.
