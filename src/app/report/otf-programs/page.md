During the time period covered by this report, OTF implemented the following funds, labs, and fellowship programs.

## Funds

OTF provided direct funding to support the applied research, development, implementation, and maintenance of technologies that enable censorship circumvention and enhance user security and privacy online. OTF managed multiple funds that supported innovative global internet freedom projects, large- scale circumvention and secure communications technologies, and emergency support mechanisms.

These funds included:

### Internet Freedom Fund (IFF)

The Internet Freedom Fund is the primary fund through which OTF supports innovative global internet freedom projects. IFF projects are primarily focused on technology development and implementation but can also include applied research and digital security projects.

### Technology at Scale Fund (transitioning to the Surge and Sustain Fund in 2023)

The Technology at Scale Fund supports the large-scale circumvention and secure communication technology needs of USAGM’s networks (Voice of America, Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty, Office of Cuba Broadcasting, Radio Free Asia, and Middle East Broadcasting Networks). The fundsolicits technology solutions that help deliver content to audiences in information-restricted environments and protects journalists and their sources. The fund also ensures that technologies used at scale by millions of users remain secure and effective.

### Rapid Response Fund

The Rapid Response Fund provides emergency support to independent media outlets, journalists, and human rights defenders facing digital attacks. The support through this fund helps individuals and groups stay safe in repressive environments, regain online access, mitigate future attacks, and combat sudden censorship events. The fund also provides rapid support to mitigate new software vulnerabilities, including the development and deployment of emergency technical patches, to ensure that critical internet freedom tools remain secure.

## Labs

OTF provided support to existing internet freedom projects through the organization’s Resource Labs (Labs). OTF offers expert services to the internet freedom community through its five lab offerings: [Engineering Lab](#engineering-lab), [Red Team Lab](#red-team-lab), [Secure Usability and Accessibility Lab](#secure-usability-and-accessibility-lab), [Localization Lab](#localization-lab), and [Learning Lab](#localization-lab).

Together, these labs provide security code audits, usability assessments, engineering support, translation and localization assistance, and secure cloud storage. These services ensure that the technologies incubated and supported by OTF are as effective, secure, and usable as possible.

### Engineering Lab

OTF’s Engineering Lab helps to secure the technological infrastructure behind internet freedom technologies. This lab focuses on supporting the implementation and inclusion of established technologies into existing applications, organizations, and communities that are advancing internet freedom. This includes facilitating the widespread adoption of underlying circumvention and privacy technologies, supporting the infrastructure that addresses the unique needs of internet freedom developers and end-users, and gaining better insights into the costs required to enhance existing systems.

### Red Team Lab

OTF’s Red Team Lab conducts independent security audits of internet freedom technologies to help improve the security of projects and ensure a safer experience for people experiencing repressive information controls online. The primary work of this lab is reviewing and responding to security issues in internet freedom software and tools.

### Secure Usability and Accessibility Lab

OTF’s Secure Usability and Accessibility Lab improves the usability of open-source circumvention and digital security technologies. This lab supports software development teams in the creation and improvement of projects that aim to help journalists, human rights defenders, and everyday citizens communicate privately and securely. The Secure Usability and Accessibility Lab offers secure usability audits, user experience consultations, usability testing, user research, user studies, and more.

### Localization Lab

OTF’s Localization Lab helps to localize internet freedom tools into over 200 languages for different countries and regions. Addressing a major challenge for internet freedom technologies of reach and adoption, this lab helps adapt internet freedom tools that are relevant and appropriate for another country or culture.

### Learning Lab

OTF’s Learning Lab helps to tell the stories of OTF-supported projects and the results they produce. Through this lab, projects and fellows communicate the results of their projects. This lab helps to facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration across the internet freedom community.

## Fellowships

OTF supports individuals in carrying out cutting-edge applied research projects that examine how authoritarian states are restricting the free flow of information and explore ways citizens can overcome those tactics. OTF fellowships help cultivate the next generation of internet freedom experts by creating a career track for those who have the skills and passion for internet freedom.

### Information Controls Fellowship Program (ICFP)

The Information Controls Fellowship Program (ICFP) supports research efforts to examine how authoritarian governments are restricting the free flow of information and to explore solutions to overcome these evolving tactics.
